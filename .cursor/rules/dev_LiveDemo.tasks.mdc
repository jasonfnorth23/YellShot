# 📡 Dev Tasks – Live Demo Preparation

Prepares a fully functional, clean version of YellShot for live demos to users, press, or investors.

---

## 🎯 Demo Personas

- [ ] Choose 2-3 personas for live test (e.g., Dr. Confession, DJ Regret, Sister Sorry)
- [ ] Preload short messages into system
- [ ] Host voice samples and reaction clips (pre-recorded)

---

## 🧪 Stable Flow

- [ ] Run full payment → message → call → playback
- [ ] Hardcode Stripe in test mode (or skip payment step)
- [ ] Auto-fill recipient number and consent logic for demo

---

## 📱 Playback UX

- [ ] Demo link opens with:
  - Player for `final_call.mp3`
  - Reaction text transcript (optional)
- [ ] Add fun CTA: “Want to send your own? Visit YellShot.com”

---

## 📷 Presentation Setup

- [ ] Capture screen recording of entire flow
- [ ] Script a voiceover for investor/launch page
- [ ] Make sure fallback logic and error states are hidden during demo

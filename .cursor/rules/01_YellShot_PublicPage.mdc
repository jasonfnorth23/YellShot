## 🧑‍💻 MVP Scope Summary

- Single-page public interface for users to configure and pay for their YellShot call  
- Embedded Stripe Elements payment form (no page redirects)  
- Fields for call type, persona, message, and delivery speed tier  
- Payment triggers call queue after backend confirmation  

---

## 📄 How the Public Page Works

The public-facing page allows a user to:  
1. Choose a **Call Type** (e.g., Breakup, Roast, Confession)  
2. Pick a **Persona** filtered by call type  
3. Write a **custom message** (up to 500 characters)  
4. Select a **delivery speed tier** ($5 / $20 / $50)  
5. Pay via embedded **Stripe Elements form**  
6. On successful payment, message is submitted to queue and user sees confirmation  

All form data is autosaved to the backend as a `pending_message` **before** payment begins.

## 📋 Form Field Definitions

| Field              | Type                | Notes                                      |
|-------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Call Type          | Dropdown            | Filters persona options                    |
| Persona            | Dropdown            | Filtered by call type                      |
| Message            | Textarea            | 500 character limit, profanity filtered    |
| Delivery Speed     | Radio buttons       | $5, $20, $50 tiers                         |
| Email              | Text input          | Required for support and receipts          |
| Credit Card Fields | Stripe CardElement  | Secure + PCI compliant                     |
| Phone Number        | Text input          | E.164 format required (e.g. +15555555555)  |

---

## ✅ Form Validation & Autosave

- All fields are required before enabling payment
- Message is profanity filtered and capped at 500 characters


- Autosave behavior:  
  - Form autosaves to backend on field blur  
  - If payment fails, user data is not lost

## 🕒 Quiet Hours Tier Restrictions – Public Page MDC

---

### 🎯 Purpose

Limit late-night delivery for Free and Standard tier, while allowing Expedited and Front of the Line tiers to bypass restrictions and deliver immediately.

---

### 🕰️ Quiet Hours Definition

- Quiet Hours = **10:00 PM – 7:00 AM (recipient’s local time)**  
- Recipient local time is estimated by:
  - Phone number region via Twilio Lookup
  - (Optional) User-submitted region

---

### 🛒 Tier Options Behavior

| Tier             | After-Hours Status        |
|------------------|---------------------------|
| Free             | Delayed until 7:00 AM     |
| Standard         | Delayed until 7:00 AM     |
| Expedited ($20)  | Delivered immediately     |
| Front of Line ($50) | Delivered immediately  |

---

### 💬 Display Logic at Checkout

- If current time in recipient's region is **within Quiet Hours**:

#### For Free / Standard:
> “This message will be delivered after 7:00 AM in the recipient’s timezone.”

#### For Expedited / Front of Line:
> “This message will be delivered immediately — even during quiet hours.”

---

### 🧠 Optional UX Enhancements

- Disable selection of Free/Standard tiers during quiet hours *unless* user accepts delay
- Highlight Expedited/Front of Line as "Urgent Night Delivery" options

---

## 💳 Stripe Elements Integration

- Stripe Elements embedded inline — no redirect  
- On “Pay & Send YellShot!” click:  
  1. Backend creates `PaymentIntent` with `pending_message_id`  
  2. Client confirms via `stripe.confirmCardPayment`  
  3. Stripe webhook triggers queue processing

**Stripe Metadata includes:**  
- `call_type`  
- `persona`  
- `message_id`  
- `delivery_tier`  
- `phone_number`  
- `email`

---

## 💸 Delivery Tiers

All call requests are placed in a queue and processed on a FIFO basis (first in, first out).  
**Pay more to skip the line.**

| One-Time Fee | Tier Name          | Call Placed Within     |
|--------------|--------------------|-------------------------|
| $5           | Standard Call       | 4–8 hours              |
| $20          | Expedited Call      | 1 hour                 |
| $50          | Front of the Line   | A few minutes (priority)|

Notes:
- Tier affects queue priority
- Backend enforces timing thresholds
- Tier is stored as: `5`, `20`, or `50`

---

## 📦 Post-Payment Flow

- Stripe webhook confirms successful payment  
- Backend marks message as `paid`  
- Enters delivery queue based on tier  
- User sees success message: “Your YellShot is locked and loaded.”  
- **No page redirect** — UI confirms inline  
- Backend links Stripe `PaymentIntent` to `pending_message`
- Backend validates and reattaches metadata (e.g., if tab closed)
- Twilio call is queued by backend once all metadata is confirmed

## FAQ
To be added to the bottom of the public page.

What is the success rate?
- 99% of our messages are received as follows:
- 50% pick up on first call attempt
- 30% click the callback link
- 19% receive a text message of your message, since they failed to pickup or callback
- Less than 1% fail due to some obscure reason unrelated to YellShot.com

What if the call does not go through?
If the recipient does not answer, hangs up, or the wrong person answers the call then:
- A text message will be sent encouraging them to initiate a call back when they are ready to receive the message.  This link will remain active for 10 days before it will expire.
- A final call attempt will be made 1 hr after the original attempt.
- A text message of your message will be sent, since they failed to pickup or callback

Are failures refunded?
We are unable to offer refunds for several reasons, including the fact that bad actors would then exploit our service to harass numbers they know will not pick up (and therefore get an auto-refund).
Fortunately our service has a high success rate, so you're unlikely to ever want a refund anyhow.

## ⛔ No Redirects

All confirmations, errors, and visual feedback are inline.  
This maintains the emotional rhythm and narrative flow of the experience.

## 🎬 1. Introduction & Identity Confirmation

"Hello. This is <Persona Name>, calling from <Organization Name>.  
I have a confidential message intended for <Recipient Name>. Are you <Recipient Name>?"

**If NO:**  
"Alright — no worries. If you’d like to know more, visit YellShot.com. Have a curious day."

**If YES:**  
"Thanks for confirming. Just so you know, this call may be recorded for quality assurance —  
and by continuing, you consent. Ready for the confidential message?"

## 💌 2. Deliver the Message

"Ok — here is the message, just as it was given to me…"  

[Insert user-written message dynamically here]

## 🎤 3. Ask for Reaction

"So… what’s your first reaction to that?"  

[Record recipient’s verbal reaction]

## 🧨 4. Stir the Pot Follow-up

"Let me ask you this — if the roles were reversed, would you have had the guts to say that out loud?"

Using the previous message and recipient's reaction, generate a short, provocative follow-up question or comment that stirs the pot — something that challenges their point of view or adds emotional tension. Keep it under 15 words. Match the persona’s tone: <savage | regretful | clinical | sarcastic | glitchy | cheerful>.


## 🔥 5. Escalate with Insult/Challenge

"Because from the sound of it, you’ve been dodging this conversation like it owes you money."

## 📲 6. Tell Them They Can Reply Anonymously (No Consent Needed)

"I’ve also sent you a text. If you've got something to say back —  
you can reply anonymously, for free."

> (System sends SMS automatically with secure reply link and promo)

- No user confirmation needed  
- Reply link is preloaded with `message_id` and one-time promo token  
- SMS copy:
  ```
  Want to reply anonymously?  
  Tap here to respond FREE:  
  https://yellshot.com/reply/<token>
  ```

---

## 📣 7. Call Closure & Brand Pitch

"This message was delivered by <Persona Name> via YellShot.com —  
Let AI do the talking. That’s YELL SHOT dot com."

---

## 🔐 One-Time Free Reply Logic

### 🎯 Goal
Prevent abuse of free reply promo while still encouraging first-time engagement.

---

### ✅ Who Gets the Free Promo

- Only recipients **who have never been sent a YellShot before**
- Determined by checking `queue_history` for any previous `recipient_phone`

---

### 🚫 Who *Does Not* Get It

- If `recipient_phone` **already exists** in `queue_history` table:
  - No free reply promo
  - Regular reply pricing applies (same as sending a YellShot)

---

### 📊 Database Logic (Pseudocode)

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM queue_history
WHERE recipient_phone = '<number>'
```

- If result = 0 → allow free promo
- Else → deny promo, proceed to payment step

---

### 🧬 SMS Reply Link Handling

- If **promo allowed**:
  ```
  Want to reply anonymously?  
  Tap here to respond FREE:  
  https://yellshot.com/reply/<token>?promo=1
  ```
- If **promo denied**:
  ```
  Want to reply anonymously?  
  Tap here to respond:  
  https://yellshot.com/reply/<token>
  ```

> Frontend checks for `promo=1` query param to unlock free usage

---

### 🧾 Metadata Fields (Database)

```json
{
  "recipient_phone": "+15555551234",
  "has_received_before": true,
  "promo_eligible": false,
  "reply_token": "abc123",
  "promo_used": false
}
```

---

### 🧠 Anti-Gaming Note

- Token is single-use and locked to `recipient_phone`
- Free promo flag invalidated upon:
  - Successful reply purchase
  - Or expiration window (e.g. 48 hours)

---

## 🔊 Voice Synthesis Engine

- Uses ElevenLabs API for text-to-speech.
- Each prompt is composed using:

```text
[intro_script] + " " + [user_message] + " " + [optional_follow_up_question]
```

- Example:

This is Miss Closure, calling from the Bureau of Second Chances. I have a confidential message for Jamie.  It reads:
"I still think about you at night. It’s dumb, I know."

"What would you do if I said it in person?"

- Configuration includes:
- `stability`
- `similarity_boost`
- `speed`
- `style` (if supported)

---

## 🔁 Follow-Up Logic

- After delivering the message, the AI voice asks:
- “So.. yea that's the entire message.  Ummm... thoughts?”

- A second persona-specific question based on call type (e.g., “Would you take them back?” or “If they were here, what would you say?”)
- The recording of the call is sent to the sender so the goal is to provoke the recipient to speak now bluntly and not hold back.

## 🧠 Prompt Composition Logic

Final message =  
`[intro_script] + [legal_consent] + [flavor_addon] + [user_message] + [stir_the_pot] + [escalation] + [cta]`

- Prompts are filtered by persona tone
- Optional debug mode logs all inputs and final strings
- Prompts are truncated if total length exceeds API limits

---

## 🧪 Voice QA & Testing Checklist

- ✅ Does the tone match the persona’s intent?
- ✅ Is the consent line clear, upfront, and neutral?
- ✅ Are pauses/breaths/natural flow acceptable?
- ✅ Is there audio clipping or artifacting?
- ✅ Did the AI voice say all dynamic names correctly?

*Record at least 1 test call per persona per call type before release.*

## 📘 Persona Design Notes

- Each persona should have:
  - A distinct vocal tone and lexicon
  - A fictional agency name that reinforces theme
  - Clear alignment with 1–2 call types
  - A “signature” intro line or catchphrase (optional)

Use tags to control appearance frequency, edginess, or NSFW boundaries.

---

## 🛑 Moderation & Blocklist Filters

Before synthesis, input is filtered against a dynamic keyword list:

```json
{
  "blocklist": [
    "kill yourself",
    "slur:*",
    "racial hate",
    "private phone number",
    "home address",
    "death threat"
  ],
  "moderation_actions": {
    "replace": "[censored]",
    "flag": true,
    "log": true
  }
}
```

*Optional user alert: “Your message has been lightly edited for compliance.”*

---

## 🎯 Auto-Tone Validation Logic

Before generation, AI checks for **tone mismatch** between message and persona tone:

```json
{
  "persona_tone": "cheerful",
  "user_message": "I hope your cat dies and your house burns down.",

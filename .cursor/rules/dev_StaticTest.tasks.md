# ⚡ Dev Tasks – Static Glitch Sound Testing

Handles logic for playing a random static MP3 sound when switching stations or transitioning between calls.

---

## 🎧 Sound Library

- [ ] Store static MP3s at:
  - `https://kissfist.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/1.mp3` through `13.mp3`
- [ ] Confirm all files are uploaded and accessible

---

## 🔁 Playback Logic

- [ ] On ⚡ station change or call transition:
  - Randomly select one MP3
  - Play before main audio begins
- [ ] Volume balance test (should not overpower message)
- [ ] Optionally fade out into real message

---

## 🧪 Testing

- [ ] Validate randomization works correctly
- [ ] Test latency between static and message playback
- [ ] Confirm MP3 files are not blocked by browser security

## 🕒 After-Hours Handling – Final Logic (Standard Tier Only)

---

### 🎯 Purpose

Internally delay Standard tier calls during quiet hours (10PM–7AM recipient local time), while allowing all other tiers to be delivered 24/7.

---

### 🕰️ Quiet Hours Definition

- Quiet Hours = **10:00 PM – 7:00 AM (recipient’s local time)**
- Local time estimated from phone number region (Twilio Lookup)

---

### 🧮 Tier Behavior

- **Standard ($5)** tier:
  - Delivery is **paused** during quiet hours
  - Call is queued and resumes at 7:00 AM
- **All other tiers**:
  - Delivered **immediately**, even during quiet hours

---

### 📦 Metadata (Logged per Standard-tier Message)

```json
{
  "requested_tier": "standard",
  "is_after_hours": true,
  "scheduled_for": "2025-06-06T07:00:00-0500",
  "status": "queued"
}
```

---

// 🕒 After-Hours Hold Logic (Standard Tier Only)
//
// If the message tier is "standard" ($5),
// and the current time in the recipient’s local timezone is between 10:00 PM – 7:00 AM,
// then hold delivery until 7:00 AM local time.
// All other tiers bypass this restriction and are delivered immediately.

if (tier === 'standard' && isAfterHours(recipientTimeZone)) {
  scheduleFor = next7amInTimezone(recipientTimeZone);
  status = 'queued';
  log("Standard-tier message delayed until morning due to quiet hours");
}

---

### 🧠 Queue Processor Logic (Standard Tier Quiet Hours)

- If `tier = standard` and current time in recipient’s timezone is between 10:00 PM and 7:00 AM:
  - Do **not** trigger the outbound call immediately
  - Instead, set `status = queued`
  - Set `scheduled_for = next 7:00 AM in recipient’s timezone`
  - Resume delivery when that time is reached

---

**Example pseudocode:**

```js
if (tier === 'standard' && isAfterHours(recipientTimeZone)) {
  scheduleFor = next7amInTimezone(recipientTimeZone);
  status = 'queued';
}
```

---

> Timezone awareness is based on recipient phone prefix via Twilio Lookup API  
> This logic is internal and silent — users are not shown any delay

---

### ⚠️ SLA Integrity

- Standard tier still promises **delivery within 4–8 hours**
- Delays due to quiet hours are absorbed within that window

---

### 🧠 Internal Only

- No impact on Public Page UX
- No toggle or messaging required for users
- Behavior managed silently by the queue processor

---

## 📤 Post-Call SMS Sequence Logic (Updated)

### 1️⃣ After Successful Call Delivery

- Automatically send follow-up SMS **after successful call**:
  ```
  You just got a YellShot. Want to reply anonymously?  
  Tap here to send your response FREE:  
  https://yellshot.com/reply/<token>
  ```
- Includes:
  - One-time promo for **free reply**
  - Link preloaded with original `message_id`
  - Tracks usage to prevent repeat redemption

---

### 2️⃣ After Failed Call Attempt (No Answer or Declined)

- Immediately send SMS:
  ```
  We just tried to deliver a confidential message to you via phone.  
  Tap to hear it now:  
  https://yellshot.com/redeem/<token>
  ```
- Link opens call-back prompt on web, or triggers retry flow if allowed

---

### 3️⃣ After 24 Hours of Failed Attempts (Final SMS)

- If no call pickup and no user-initiated callback within 24h:
  - Send final fallback SMS with the message (text version) + reply CTA:
  ```
  This message couldn’t be delivered by phone:  
  “<shortened message preview>...”  
  Tap to hear the full version + reply FREE:  
  https://yellshot.com/redeem/<token>
  ```
- Includes:
  - Full or partial message (based on privacy config)
  - Free reply link with tracking
  - Final notice that this is the last attempt

---

## 🔐 One-Time Free Reply Logic

### 🎯 Goal
Prevent abuse of free reply promo while still encouraging first-time engagement.

---

### ✅ Who Gets the Free Promo

- Only recipients **who have never been sent a YellShot before**
- Determined by checking `queue_history` for any previous `recipient_phone`

---

### 🚫 Who *Does Not* Get It

- If `recipient_phone` **already exists** in `queue_history` table:
  - No free reply promo
  - Regular reply pricing applies (same as sending a YellShot)

---

### 📊 Database Logic (Pseudocode)

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM queue_history
WHERE recipient_phone = '<number>'
```

- If result = 0 → allow free promo
- Else → deny promo, proceed to payment step

---

### 🧬 SMS Reply Link Handling

- If **promo allowed**:
  ```
  Want to reply anonymously?  
  Tap here to respond FREE:  
  https://yellshot.com/reply/<token>?promo=1
  ```
- If **promo denied**:
  ```
  Want to reply anonymously?  
  Tap here to respond:  
  https://yellshot.com/reply/<token>
  ```

> Frontend checks for `promo=1` query param to unlock free usage

---

### 🧾 Metadata Fields (Database)

```json
{
  "recipient_phone": "+15555551234",
  "has_received_before": true,
  "promo_eligible": false,
  "reply_token": "abc123",
  "promo_used": false
}
```

---

### 🧠 Anti-Gaming Note

- Token is single-use and locked to `recipient_phone`
- Free promo flag invalidated upon:
  - Successful reply purchase
  - Or expiration window (e.g. 48 hours)

---

## 🧾 SMS Event Tracking (DB Fields)

```json
{
  "sms_success_sent_at": "2025-06-05T14:15:00Z",
  "sms_failed_sent_at": "2025-06-05T14:18:00Z",
  "sms_final_sent_at": "2025-06-06T14:12:00Z",
  "reply_token": "xyz789",
  "promo_used": false
}
```

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Maximize engagement and reply funnel
- Avoid user friction — no consent step for SMS
- Automate logical progression: Success ➜ Retry ➜ Final Fallback
- Deliver **at least one form** of the message in all outcomes

---

## 📲 Twilio Call Flow

- Triggered by queue processor
- Uses `voice.xml` or dynamic TwiML URL
- Updates:
  - `in_progress`: call initiated
  - `delivered`: call succeeded
  - `undelivered`: all retries failed

---

## 📞 Twilio Webhook Handling

- Webhook receives call events:  
  `initiated`, `ringing`, `in-progress`, `completed`, `failed`, `no-answer`  
- On call start: set `message.status = in_progress`  
- On answer: start audio playback  
- On completion: mark `delivered`  
- Record recipient’s voice (if response enabled)  
- Store `Twilio RecordingUrl` in `audio_url`  
- Validate all requests using `X-Twilio-Signature`  

---

## 📥 Recording & Playback

- Twilio call is recorded via `<Record>` element or TwiML attribute
- Recording is:
  - Automatically stored by Twilio
  - URL returned via webhook (`RecordingUrl`)
  - Saved to `call.audio_url` in database
- Admin panel:  
  - Shows downloadable playback link in queue history  
  - Button: `▶ Play Response` and `⬇ Download MP3`  
- If user gave a response:
  - File labeled `reaction.mp3`
- Final MP3 URL is also accessible in:
  - Sender dashboard (if allowed by privacy setting)
  - Internal QA audit view

---

## 📵 No Voicemail Policy

- If recipient does **not answer** the call:  
  - **Do not leave a voicemail**  
  - Disconnect cleanly without message playback  
  - Reason: maintain mystery, avoid unwanted trace, preserve anonymity tone

---

## 📤 Post-Call SMS (After Answer)

- If call is **answered** and message is **delivered**:
  - Send **follow-up SMS** immediately after call ends:
    ```
    Would you like to reply to the confidential message?  Send a YellSpot anonymously:
    https://yellshot.com/reply/<message_id_or_token>
    ```
  - SMS includes:
    - Anonymized reply link
    - Token or message ID that ties to original sender

---

## 🧬 Reply Linking Logic

- On successful call completion:
  - Store `message_id` or `reply_token` in DB
  - Attach `original_sender_id` to call record
  - Construct reply URL: `https://yellshot.com/reply/<reply_token>`
  - Log that SMS was sent (timestamp, delivery status)

---

## 📁 Reply Metadata Fields (Database)

```json
{
  "message_id": "abc123",
  "reply_token": "xYz789",
  "original_sender_id": "user_42",
  "reply_url": "https://yellshot.com/reply/xYz789",
  "sms_sent_at": "2025-06-05T14:17:00Z"
}
```

---

## 🔗 Public Page Reply Handling (To Document Separately)

> Note: The following logic belongs in the Public Page MDC but is tightly linked here.

- The `/reply/<reply_token>` route should:
  - Auto-fill “To: Anonymous Sender” (mapped via token)
  - Let recipient:
    - Type a reply message
    - Select persona
    - Purchase YellShot reply
  - Ensure new reply is tied to `original_sender_id`

---

## 🔁 Retry Logic

- Up to **3 attempts**  
- Delays: **5min → 15min → 30min**  
- Retries only within `expires_at` SLA window  
- Final failure marks status = `undelivered`  

---

## ⚠️ Edge Case Handling

| Condition       | Action                                                  |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Call failed     | Retry if within retry count + SLA window                |
| No answer       | Retry with increasing delay                             |
| User declined   | Mark as `undelivered` if decline confirmed              |
| Invalid number  | Mark as `undelivered`, no retry                         |
| Twilio error    | Retry once, escalate if still failing                   |

---

## 🔐 Webhook Security

- Validate every incoming webhook against `X-Twilio-Signature`  
- Use signing secret stored in secure environment variable  
- Log validation failures with timestamp + IP + reason  

---

## 📦 Call Record Contents

```json
{
  "twilio_sid": "CAxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "call_duration": 62,
  "status": "delivered",
  "audio_url": "https://api.twilio.com/recordings/abc123",
  "timestamp": "2025-06-05T14:12:00Z",
  "attempt": 2
}
```

## 📞 YellShot PRD – 02: Call Delivery Engine (Twilio) – DIAMOND++

---

## 🛡️ Abuse Protection & Rate Limits

- **Rate limiting**: Max 5 call attempts per IP/hour  
- **Twilio Lookup API**: Validate phone numbers before queuing  
- **Anomaly detection**:  
  - Detect rapid retries to same number  
  - Flag messages with banned keywords or spam patterns  
- **CAPTCHA**: Enforce on public form to prevent bot spam

---

## 🧠 Smart Retry Optimizer

- **Dynamic retry scheduling**:  
  - Optimize retry times based on historical success by region  
  - Avoid retries during non-business hours or user-defined “quiet hours”  
- **Time zone detection**:  
  - Infer recipient’s local time from phone prefix or carrier  
  - Reschedule retries intelligently

---

## 🧬 Metadata Enrichment

- Use **Twilio Lookup API** to enrich recipient metadata:  
  - `carrier`, `line_type`, `is_mobile`, `country_code`  
- Store enriched fields with each call record  
- Use enriched metadata to determine retry strategy:
  - No retry for `line_type: voip` or `carrier: unknown` if fallback is enabled

---

## 🛑 Consent & Compliance Log

- Log consent and compliance details per message:  
  ```json
  {
    "consent_to_call": true,
    "consent_to_record": true,
    "ip_address": "192.0.2.45",
    "user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0",
    "timestamp": "2025-06-05T14:01:00Z"
  }
  ```
- Geo-block or hard-deny delivery to restricted regions (GDPR, CCPA, TCPA, etc.)
- Auto-expire consent logs after retention window (configurable, e.g., 18 months)

---

## 📂 Call Bundle Archival

- After each call, create an S3 folder: `yellshot/audio/{call_id}/`  
- Store:
  - `ai_message.mp3`
  - `reaction.mp3`
  - `final_call.mp3`
  - `bundle.json`:

```json
{
  "call_id": "abc123",
  "status": "delivered",
  "tier": "express",
  "twilio_sid": "CAxxxxx",
  "call_duration": 62,
  "persona": "Dr. Confession",
  "call_type": "breakup",
  "recording_url": "https://api.twilio.com/recordings/xyz",
  "response_url": "https://cdn.yellshot.com/audio/abc123/reaction.mp3",
  "timestamp": "2025-06-05T14:12:00Z",
  "retry_attempts": 2
}
```

- Optional: zip archive auto-generated for user download

- QA override flags (force "delivered" or escalate for review)

---

## 🚨 Failover Strategy

- **Twilio API Timeout Handling**:
  - Retry API call with exponential backoff (up to 3x)
  - Trigger dev alert if API fails > 1 minute window
- **Missing Audio**:
  - Log `status: error`
  - Send fallback SMS with failure notice
  - Alert admin for manual intervention

---

## 🧩 Event Hooks (Extended)

- `onCallStarted(call_id)`
- `onCallDelivered(call_id)`
- `onCallFailed(call_id, reason)`

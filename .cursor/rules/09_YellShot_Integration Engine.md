# üîÄ YellShot PRD ‚Äì 09: Integration Engine

## üéØ Purpose

Coordinates the end-to-end flow once a user completes payment:
1. Generates character-specific dialog via LLM
2. Sends dialog to Cartesia AI for TTS
3. Stores resulting MP3 in S3
4. Queues a Twilio call for delivery
5. Updates call status and links to final recording

---

## üß© Orchestration Flow

### Trigger: Payment Success (`delivered` from Stripe webhook)

1. **Extract Configuration:**
   - Call type
   - Persona
   - User message
   - Delivery tier

2. **Generate Persona Script**
   - Endpoint: `POST /generate-response`
   - Input: JSON with persona name, tone, message, recipient info
   - Output: Character-enhanced response text

3. **Generate Voice File**
   - Endpoint: `POST /generate-voice`
   - Input: Response text + Cartesia voice ID
   - Output: `ai_message.mp3` stored in S3

4. **Initiate Twilio Call**
   - Prepare TwiML or dynamic `voice.xml` that plays `ai_message.mp3`
   - Handle:
     - Identity confirmation
     - Consent prompt
     - Message delivery
     - Stir-the-pot follow-up
     - Reaction recording

5. **Record Outcome**
   - Save call status to DB
   - Upload `reaction.mp3` to S3
   - Combine into `final_call.mp3` (optional)

6. **Notify Sender**
   - Send email/SMS with ‚ÄúHear Their Reaction‚Äù link
